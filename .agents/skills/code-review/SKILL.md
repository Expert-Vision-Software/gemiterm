description: "Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along three axes: Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?), Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/spec asked for?), and Regression (did the change degrade quality against the test baseline?). Runs all three reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."
---

Three-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?
- **Regression**: does the change degrade quality against the test baseline?

All three axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here, not inside the parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.), fetched via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below: a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle it into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 3b. Identify the regression sources

Confirm the quality-gate files exist; if any are missing, skip the Regression sub-agent and note it in the final report:

- `docs/agents/testing-protocol.md` — thresholds and pass/fail criteria.
- The baseline file the protocol points at (this repo: `docs/agents/testing-baseline.xml`).

### 4. Spawn all three sub-agents in parallel

Send a single message with three sub-agent calls so they run concurrently.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full (the sub-agent has no other access to it).
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

**Regression sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The fixed point from step 1, as a **scope hint only**: the regression eval runs against the working tree and baseline, not the diff, so the sub-agent uses the fixed point to describe the change surface (pending files, latest commit, or branch wrap-up), never to scope the test run.
- The paths from step 3b: `docs/agents/testing-protocol.md` and the baseline file it names.
- The instruction to load the `regression-checking` skill (which loads `test-baselining`) and run `eval`, reusing cached results when source control is unchanged since the last eval.
- The brief: "Run the regression check per the regression-checking skill and report: (1) the structured agent decision signal (decision, status, summary, violations, risk_level, next_actions) verbatim as a code block; (2) the human-readable narrative. No other prose. Under 300 words total."

### 5. Aggregate

Present the reports under `## Standards`, `## Spec`, and `## Regression` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings, because the axes are deliberately separate (see _Why multiple axes_). The Regression section carries the decision signal verbatim — never fold it into an overall verdict.

End with a one-line summary per axis: total findings for Standards and Spec, and the decision signal for Regression. Don't pick a single winner across axes: that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why multiple axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**
- Code that looks clean and implements the right thing but drops test coverage or slows the build → **Standards pass, Spec pass, Regression fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking another.
